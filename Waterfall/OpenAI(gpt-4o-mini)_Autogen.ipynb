      "     - **Total**: **10**\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Total Count of Requirements:**\n",
      "   By adding the totals from each phase:\n",
      "   - 60 (Requirements Gathering) + 20 (System Design) + 20 (Implementation) + 20 (Testing) + 8 (Deployment) + 10 (Maintenance) = **138 Total Requirements**.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Estimation of Pages and Productivity Rate:**\n",
      "   - Assuming that each requirement is detailed enough to take about half a page on average (covering context, acceptance criteria, and attributes), we can estimate:\n",
      "     - **Total Pages of Requirements Document**: \n",
      "       - Total Requirements (138) x 0.5 pages = **69 pages**.\n",
      "\n",
      "   - **Productivity Rate:**\n",
      "     As an industry standard, a Requirements Engineer can typically draft and finalize approximately 2 pages per hour of requirements documentation (considering time for discussions, revisions, and validations).\n",
      "     - **Estimated Productivity Rate** = **2 pages per hour**.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Real-Time Counts:**\n",
      "   - If we were to assume that the Requirements Gathering phase (4 weeks) is the lift-off point and takes 160 hours (8-hour days x 20 days), we expect about:\n",
      "     - Pages produced during this phase: 2 pages/hour * 160 hours = **320 pages**.\n",
      "     - However, as we focus on quality and the necessity of precisely documenting the 138 requirements, we’d likely have multiple iterations and validations which would take a greater amount of time in reality.\n",

      "     - **Non-functional Test Cases**: To assess performance, usability, and security.\n",
