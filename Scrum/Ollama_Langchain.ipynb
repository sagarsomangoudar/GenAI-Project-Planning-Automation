      "\n",
      "Based on the requirements and technology stack used in this project, I would recommend using a microservices architecture. The system consists of multiple independent components (e.g., product listing page, order creation form, customer profile management) that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why microservices?**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Scalability: Each component can be scaled independently to handle changes in traffic or demand.\n",
      "2. Flexibility: Components can be developed using different programming languages, frameworks, or technologies without affecting the overall system.\n",
      "3. Maintainability: With a monolithic architecture, making changes to one component can affect the entire system. In a microservices architecture, changes are isolated to individual components.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why not monolithic?**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Complexity: A monolithic architecture can lead to increased complexity and coupling between components.\n",
      "2. Maintenance: Making changes to one component in a monolithic system can affect the entire system, leading to longer maintenance times.\n",
      "3. Scalability: Monolithic systems can be challenging to scale horizontally, as each component must be scaled individually.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Technology comparison**\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a brief comparison of the technologies used in this project:\n",
      "\n",
      "| Technology | Monolithic vs. Microservices |\n",
      "| --- | --- |\n",
      "| Java 11 | Suitable for microservices architecture due to its modular design and scalability features. |\n",
      "| Spring Boot | Suitable for both monolithic and microservices architectures, but is more commonly used with microservices. |\n",
      "| PostgreSQL | Suitable for both monolithic and microservices architectures, but is often used as a database in microservices systems. |\n",
      "| MongoDB | Suitable for microservices architecture due to its document-based data model and scalability features. |\n",
